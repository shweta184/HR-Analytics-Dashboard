## 📌 Key Insights

- 👥 The company currently has **1,470 active employees**, indicating a moderately sized workforce that requires structured HR policies and performance tracking.
- 📉 The **attrition rate is 16.17%**, which may signal employee dissatisfaction or organizational issues. This should be further analyzed by department and tenure to design retention strategies.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The workforce is **male-dominated (~61.6%)**, showing a gender imbalance that HR may want to address through inclusive hiring practices to improve diversity.
- 🏢 The **Sales** and **Research & Development (R&D)** departments have the highest headcount. This reflects business priorities, but also points to potential stress zones for turnover and training needs.
- ⭐ A large portion of employees have a **performance rating of 3**, suggesting an average-performing workforce. This may indicate room for improvement in employee motivation, recognition, or training programs.
- 🎓 Most employees hold a **Bachelor’s degree**, indicating a skilled but possibly early-career workforce. There may be an opportunity to invest in upskilling programs or leadership development for future roles.

- 💍 About **63.7% of employees are married**, which might correlate with stability, but HR could also explore how personal demographics relate to attrition or engagement levels.
